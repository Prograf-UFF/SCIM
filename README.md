### DESCRIPTION
	- we present, the Spatial Contextualization for Closed Itemset Mining (SCIM) algorithm, a mining procedure that builds a metric space for  the targetdatabase in such a way that relevant closed itemsets can beretrieved regarding the relative spatial location of their items, proposed by Mantuan et al. 

### REQUIREMENTS
	- Eigen 3.2.0 or later;
  - Boost 1.5.0 or later
	- GCC 4.9.1 / MSVC 2013 or later; 

### USAGE: 
	- The proper parameters must be set in settings.h header file.
